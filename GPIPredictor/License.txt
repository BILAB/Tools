  GPIPredictor is a predictor for the prediction of glycosylphosphatidylinositol 
(GPI) lipid modification of a protein. It uses an optimized support vector machine 
(SVM) classifier to recognize the C-terminal sequence pattern and uses a voting system
based on SignalP version 3.0 to determine the presence or absence of the
N-terminal signal of a typical GPI-anchored protein.
